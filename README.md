# Main Projects Monorepo

### Welcome to my DevOps Main Projects Monorepo, a single home for hands-on AWS, Linux, Bash, and automation projects.
### This repo is structured for learning,breaking and fixing, documentation, and showcasing real-world cloud engineering skills.

## Repository Structure

Each folder contains:

A dedicated README explaining the project

Scripts, Terraform configuration, or assets

Clear documentation of steps, architecture, and testing


## What’s Inside?

# 1. Compute Projects

Focused on:

** EC2 provisioning

** User data scripts

** Web server deployments

** Lambda automations

** IAM roles & permissions

** Terraform infrastructure as code

These projects show the fundamentals every cloud engineer should know

# 2. Storage Projects

Covers:

** S3 bucket setup

** Public & private access patterns

** IAM policies for uploads

** Static website hosting

** Event-driven automation with S3 → Lambda → SNS

** Security best practices

If it touches S3, it’s in here.

## Technologies Used

** AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, IAM, CloudWatch, SNS)

** Terraform (IAC for reproducible setups)

** Bash scripting

** Linux server administration

** Git & GitHub

** Python (for Lambda functions)

## How to Use This Monorepo

Follow the README for each project

Each project is self-contained and explains:

** Architecture

** Prerequisites

** Setup steps

** Testing

** Screenshots

## Why a Monorepo?

** Keeps all projects in one clean place

** Makes navigation easier

** Encourages consistent documentation

** Perfect for recruiters reviewing cloud engineering work

** Great for portfolio building and long-term growth



## Future Improvements

Add CI/CD pipelines for each projects

Add automated tests where possible

Expand to networking and security projects

Add GitHub Actions for formatting/linting
